# thingie

the "thingie" is a multi-purpose microcontroller-based portable device that does... things. current plan is to make it play simple games, be an MP3 player, and be able to run some kind of programming interface. It can and will be extended to do cool and/or stupid and/or useless things in the future. This repo contains the PCB design, which is the most scuffed thing in the world as it uses components that don't exist and you have to make yourself by frankensteining a bunch of buttons together. Maybe one day if it works I will make a proper documentation of how to build one but right now it does not work (or even exist) so I don't see the point.
